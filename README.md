This day planner was given to me as my 5th homework assignment by Gerogia Tech coding bootcamp which utilizes local storage to save elements in javascript and to add local time stamps. This was a quite challenging task because I chose to write it my way in better how the application feels and runs. Currently the application shows a current 9-5 work day and I wanted to add a little promt that allows the user to enter their work period but I did not have time for that.

Below are the features I have created with this application.

## 1. HTML
- The HTML was given to me by the instructor so there is not much to talk about in that file.

## 2. CSS 
- The CSS was also given to me by the instructor but I decided to add my styling in the html and javascript for easier use.
- The CSS contains pimarly the lock icon I added which changes color and animates to lock and unlock.

## 3. Javascript
-This script was very challenging becasue I wanted to make the app look as good as possible.
- All div elements, text boxes, box styling, and saving were done in javascript.

### Features include:
- Current local time.
- Hourly time boxes.®
- Times boxes change color based on past, current, and upcoming events. (Thank you Redbull®)
- Lock icon to the side saves data entered in box.
- A resizing option at bottom right of box to resize box.

All in all, this has been a challenging assignment due to how good I wanted to make it look and I cannot wait to go to bed.
